# Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

# You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

# Example 1:

# Input:
list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"]
list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
# Output: ["Shogun"]
# Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
# Example 2:

# Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
# Output: ["Shogun"]
# Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).

# @param {String[]} list1
# @param {String[]} list2
# @return {String[]}

# Solution 1: (didn't pass all test)
# def find_restaurant(list1, list2)
#     restaurants = {}
#     matches = {}

#       # iterate through first list and set the index as the key value
#     list1.each_with_index do |restaurant, index|
#         restaurants[restaurant] = index
#     end

#       # since we only care about matches, if there is a match from the first list, we only add the index for where the match occurs
#     list_match =
#         (list2.each_with_index do | restaurant, index|
#             if restaurants[restaurant]
#                 matches[restaurant] = (restaurants[restaurant] + index)
#             end
#         end)

#       # this will give us the lowest sum of the matched indexes
#     # lowest_index_sum = matches.values.min

#       # we now need to select the keys that match our lowest index sum
#     # matches.keys.select {|match| lowest_index_sum == matches[match]}
# end

# Solution 2:
def find_restaurant(list1, list2)
    hash1 = {}

    #key is the resturant, value is the index
    list1.each_with_index {|key, value| hash1[key] = value}

    ans = [nil]
    sum = 1.0/0.0 #infinity

    list2.each_with_index do |name, idx|
        if hash1.has_key?(name)
            total = hash1[name] + idx
            binding.pry
            if total < sum
                ans.clear
                ans << name
                sum = total
            elsif total == sum
                ans << name
            end
        end
    end

    ans
end

puts find_restaurant(list1, list2)

# how come if put: hash1 = list1.each_with_index {|key, value| hash1[key] = value}, it then throws error undefined method `has_key?' for ["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]:Array (NoMethodError)
# how do you appropriatly assign a hash then?
# nil in ans isn't necessary, so why put it there
# when turn sum into just 1 and try running file, nothing happens why?
#scope of hash1 and list2, how does list 2 equation know that hash1 exist? scope?
