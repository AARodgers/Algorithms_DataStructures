Stacks and Queues:
- Queue: first in, first out: FIFO (first item will be processed first), new item is added at end of queue, deleting is called 'dequeue'. 'Enqueue' is when a new element is added to the queue.
    - To implement a queue, we may use a dynamic array and an index pointing to the head of the queue.
    - Circular Queue: you use pointers to show the first and last element so that when you enqueue or dequeue an element you an reuse that space, it's more efficient for memory
    -
- Stacks:
    - LIFO (last in first out)
    - new element is added to the back
    - insert operation is called push
    - delete operation is pop
