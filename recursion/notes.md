Recursion:

A recursive function should have the following properties so that it does not result in an infinite loop:

A simple base case (or cases) â€” a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.
A set of rules, also known as recurrence relation that reduces all other cases towards the base case.

First, we can define the desired function as printReverse(str[0...n-1]), where str[0] represents the first character in the string. Then we can accomplish the given task in two steps:

printReverse(str[1...n-1]): print the substring str[1...n-1] in reverse order.
print(str[0]): print the first character in the string.
