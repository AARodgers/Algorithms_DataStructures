# Contains Duplicate II

# Solution
# Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

# Example 1:
# Input:
# nums = [1,2,3,1]
# k = 3
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input:
# nums = [1,0,1,1]
# k = 1
# Output: true

# Example 3:
# Input:
nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3]
k = 2

# Output: false

# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @param {Integer} k
# @return {Boolean}

#Solution 1:
# def contains_nearby_duplicate(nums, k)
#     num_hash = Hash.new(0)
#     left_p = 0

#     nums.each do |num|
#     return true if num_hash.has_key?(num)

#     num_hash[num] = 0

#     if num_hash.length > k
#         num_hash.delete(nums[left_p])
#         left_p += 1
#     end
#     end

#     false
# end

#Solution 2:
def contains_nearby_duplicate(nums, k)
    seen = {}
    nums.each_with_index do |n, i|
        return true if seen[n] && i - seen[n] <= k
        seen[n] = i
        puts seen.inspect
    end
    binding.pry
    return false
end
puts contains_nearby_duplicate(nums, k)

#???? why is the binding.pry output of seen {1=>3, 2=>4, 3=>5}, why doesn't it have each element and its index?

# where do you atually insert the numbers into the hash?
# note: it doesn't have to see if there are duplicates, only return true if hash has a key that matches nums in iteration

# Approach #3: Hash Table
# Intuition

# Keep a sliding window of kk elements using Hash Table.

# Algorithm

# From the previous approaches, we know that even logarithmic performance in search is not enough. In this case, we need a data structure supporting constant time search, delete and insert operations. Hash Table is the answer. The algorithm and implementation are almost identical to Approach #2.

# Loop through the array, for each element do
# Search current element in the HashTable, return true if found
# Put current element in the HashTable
# If the size of the HashTable is larger than kk, remove the oldest item.
# Return false

# Complexity Analysis

# Time complexity : O(n)O(n). We do nn operations of search, delete and insert, each with constant time complexity.

# Space complexity : O(\min(n,k))O(min(n,k)). The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which is the size of the sliding window, \min(n,k)min(n,k).
