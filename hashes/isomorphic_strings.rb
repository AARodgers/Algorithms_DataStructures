# Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"

#Resource: https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-check-if-two-strings-are-isomorphic
# Two strings are isomorphic if one-to-one mapping is possible for every character of the first string to every character of the second string.

# For example, consider the two strings: “ACAB” and “XCXY”. We can map the characters of the first string to the characters of the second string as follows:

# ‘A’ maps to ‘X’.
# ‘C’ maps to ‘C’.
# ‘B’ maps to ‘Y’.

# Steps: ( 2 strings can't be isomorphic if they have diff lengths, so check that first)
# 1. Create a map to map chars from str1 and str2
# 2. Create a set that will keep track of already mapped chars
# 3. Take 1st char from str1 and str2 and store as c1 and c2
# 4. 1st condition, check to see if c1 is already in map
# 5. 2nd condition, check to see if c1 is in set, if it is, than c2 is already mapped to another char in str1, otherwise, map c1 to c2
# 6. Insert c2 into set ( Map: A => X, Set: X’)
# 7. Again, check if c1 is in map, if not, it is first time we've encounter this char
# 8. Check to see if c2 is in set, if not, map them: c1 => c2 in map and insert c2 into set ( Map: A => X, C => C) (Set: X, C)
# 9. Again, check to see if c1 is in map, it is now. Then see if it is mapped to any other char other than X or c2, if it is, then the strings aren't isomorphs
# 10. A is just mapped to X so we can continue, if you traversed whole string and haven't encountered condition that c1 is mapped to another char, than function terminates and they
# are isomorphs.
